	<h2>All tasks to lession 8</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Write a function that returns the contents of the array in reverse.</li>
		<li>Write a function that finds values in an array that repeat two or more times and returns them.</li>
		<li>Write a function that finds the smallest odd number in the array and returns it.</li>
		<li>Write a function to find the arithmetic mean of an array.</li>
		<li>Given a one-dimensional array of numbers. Write a script that determines the number positive array elements.</li>
		<li>Given a one-dimensional array of numbers. Write a script that determines the number negative elements.</li>
		<li>Given a one-dimensional array of integers. Write a script that defines the number of minimum elements.</li>
		<li> Given a one-dimensional array of integers. Write a script that defines the number of elements that are multiples of 7.</li>
		<li>Given a one-dimensional array of integers. Write a function that returns
		number of the last minimum value.</li>
		<li> Write a function that determines the number of the first maximum value in one-dimensional array of integers.</li>
		<li>Write a script that determines the number of elements
		one-dimensional array that matches the given array.</li>
		<li>Write a function that determines if there are elements in the array,
		whose values match.</li>
		<li>Write a function that determines whether all elements of an array are distinct.</li>
		<li>Write a script that determines the maximum length of a non-decreasing subsequence.</li>
		<li>Write a script that concatenates two ordered arrays like this so that all elements in the resulting array are different.</li>
		<li>Write a script that uses two arrays to build a third array that is the intersection of the given ones.</li>
		<li>Write a function that determines how many distinct numbers are in a given array.</li>
		<li>Write a function that, for a given array of integers, determines the length
		To the longest "sawtooth" sequence of consecutive numbers:
		A sequence a1, a2, a3, … , an1, an is called sawtooth if it satisfies one of the following conditions:<br/>
		1) a1 < a2 > a3 < … > an1 < an<br/>
		2) a1 > a2 < a3 > … < an1 > an</li>
		<li>Write a function that, for given two arrays X of n elements and Y of k elements determines whether there are identical consecutive elements.</li>
		<li>An array of numbers with a dimension of 10 elements is given. Write a function that sorts the array in ascending or descending order, depending on the third function parameter. If it is equal to 1, the sort is in descending order, if it is 0, then in ascending. The first 2 parameters of the function are an array and its size, the third parameter default is 1.</li>
		<li>Given an array of random numbers in the range from 20 to +20. Need to find positions extreme negative elements (the leftmost negative element and the most right negative element) and sort the elements between them.</li>
		<li>Given an array of 20 integers with values from 1 to 20. Necessary:
			○ write a function that scatters array elements randomly manner;

			○ create a random number from the same range and find the position of that a random number in an array;

			○ sort the elements of the array to the left of the found descending positions, and the array elements to the right of found position in ascending order.</li>
		<li>A two-dimensional array of 3X4 dimensions is given. We need to find the quantity elements whose value is zero.</li>
		<li>
			Given a square matrix of order n (n rows, n columns). Find the largest of the values of the elements located in the dark blue parts of the matrices.

	<h2>Sorting arrays</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Given two one-dimensional arrays with different numbers of elements and a natural number k. Merge them into one array, including the second array between k-th and (k+1)-th elements of the first, without using an additional array.</li>
		<li>Given two sequences a1<=a2<=...<=an and b1<=b2<=...<=bm. Form from them a new sequence of numbers so that it is also non-decreasing. Do not use an additional array.</li>
		<li>Selection sort. Given a sequence of numbers a1,a2,...an. Need to rearrange elements so that they are in descending order. To do this, in an array, starting with first, the largest element is selected and placed in first place, and the first - in the place of the greatest. Then, starting from the second, this procedure is repeated. Write selection sort algorithm.</li>
		<li>Exchange sorting. Given a sequence of numbers a1, a2,...an. Need to rearrange numbers in ascending order. To do this, two adjacent numbers ai and ai+1 are compared. If ai>ai+1, then a permutation is made. This continues until all elements are will be in ascending order. Write a sorting algorithm while counting the number of permutations.</li>
		<li>Insertion sort. Given a sequence of numbers a1, a2,...an. Required rearrange the numbers in ascending order. This is done in the following way. Let a1,a2,...,ai is an ordered sequence, i.e. a1<=a2<=...<=ai. taken the next number ai+1 and is inserted into the sequence so that the new the sequence was also increasing. The process continues until all elements from i+1 to n will not be iterated over.</li>

	<ol>
		<li>The function receives an array of numbers with arbitrary indices, and the desired number (value), returns the index of the found value, if not, returns FALSE</li>
		<li>The function receives an array of numbers or any other values, and sorts into even and odd numbers, all values that are not number are skipped. Returns two an array with even and odd values. return [ arr1, arr2 ]</li>
		<li>the function receives an array of arbitrary values, returns an array of two elements: the first and last value of the original array.</li>
		<li>The function receives an array of arbitrary values, it is necessary to "calculate" the array for first-second element. Returns two arrays.</li>
		<li>The function receives an array of arbitrary values, it is necessary to calculate the sum every three numbers in the array. The function returns an array of sums.</li>
		<li>The function receives an array of numbers and returns an array mixed in a random order, that is, changes the arrangement of elements in a random order</li>
