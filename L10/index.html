	<h2>Task L10</h2>
	<div>
		<p> Create a function that will create hobbits. That is, return an object that we will consider a hobbit. </p>
		<p> Hobbit - object. which has fields. Name, age and counter.</p>
		<p> The name must be passed to the function. If no name is given DO NOT create a hobbit. </p>
		<p> Age (integer) should be generated automatically and randomly in the range from 12 to 100. We will assume that years.</p>
		<p> The counter is also generated automatically. And it carries a meaning - how the hobbit was created in a row.</p>
		<p> Then use this function to create 24 hobbits with different names. Output to the console as an array. </p>
		<p> P.S. To complete the task, of course, create an html page. It is desirable to connect scripts through the "src" attribute. </p>
